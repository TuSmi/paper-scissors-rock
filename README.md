# paper-scissors-rock

This is a simple JavaScript program that plays a game of paper scissors rock. It will take a user input as a string and compare it with a randomly selected choice. Using the rules of paper scissor rock the player or the computer opponent will be awarded a point.

The game will iterate 5 times and if the player has a lower score than the computer after those rounds the message "you lose!" will be printed, otherwise print "you win!".
